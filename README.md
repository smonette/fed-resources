# Front-End Resources
Here's a list of good resources when you're starting to explore front-end development. 

### HTML + CSS

Most sites are built using a CSS preprocessor like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Sass allows you to build code systems (setting variables and standard styling) very easily. You can also break your files into partials, that compile into one big file. This makes it so much easier to navigate and maintain when you're not staring at thousands of lines of styling.

It's also good to be aware of templating tools like [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/). Full-stack apps and often even static sites are built with templates that compile into HTML. Templates give you some basic logic, and allow partials (which is awesome for code shared across pages. Think the header and footer!)



### Git

### Tools
Sometimes you're not going to have time to spin up your own site. Using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) will get you a good looking site very quickly. They also both have wonderful, detailed documentaion. 

If your site is going to be highly customized, I'd recommend starting from scratch as both of these are really opinionated. I start all my sites using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) which is a great Sass Mixin library. And for responsive grids, I add [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)!

## Inspiration
1. Look for coding meetups in your city. My fave is  "The Mixin" for Sass devs in SF.
2. Follow interesting writers and speakers on Twitter.
3. Learn by doing. If you want to get good at something, give it a try.
